# Useful R Scripts
These are a few scripts that I use across multiple projects. This repository includes:

1. `multiplot.R` - a function required for outputting multiple plots/graphs in the same image.
2. A simple line graph with points, white background, black axes, and no gridlines in [ggplot2][gg]. This file also includes code for plots with a transparent background (useful for presentations) and for exporting multiplots to a high-quality .png image.
